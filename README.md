<p>
1. Run the preprocess_yelp_dataset.py to generate the training dataset and test dataset. 
</p>
<p>
2. Run the word_dictionary.py to generate positive words dictionary and negtive words dictionary.
</p>
<p>
3. Run the naive_bayes.py to get the classication accuracy of training dataset and test dataset. The performances of them are as following:
</p>
<p>
Accuracy of training set: 0.62955 (25182/40000)
</p>
<p>
Accuracy of test set: 0.6662 (6662/10000)
